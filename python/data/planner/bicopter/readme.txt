#### Full data set:
Train the nnets with 5600 trajectories over 1e4 episodes. Restore the data afterward using nnet+acado.
check.acado10.npy: data generated from 1000 samples of the grid, re-generated by the neural nets and refined by acado in 10 iterations.
check.acado10.npy: data generated from 200 samples of the grid, re-generated by the neural nets and refined by acado in 20 iterations.

#### Partial data set
Generate 5600 points in the grid, but train from 30 points.
Regenerate the dataset using nnet+acado, with various number of iterations for acado.
Compare the policy net with the traj net.
python/data/planner/bicopter/check.30traj.1e4episode.acado2-50.npy: contains the restored data computed from a nnet trained over 30 trajectories and 1e4 episodes, with acado iterating 2,5, 10 or 50 iterations. The restored data are compared versus points of the training grid ('intra') or vs points not used in the training ('extra'). The 'extra' dataset is relevant.
